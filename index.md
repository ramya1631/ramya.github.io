##  About Me

I’m a detail-oriented and motivated learner with a strong foundation in front-end development, problem-solving, and collaboration—gained through real-world, team-based projects. I’m proficient in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Jest, with growing experience in Java and backend technologies.

I’ve always been curious about how applications work beneath the surface. That curiosity gradually evolved into a genuine passion for software development and ultimately led me to enroll in LaunchCode’s Software Development course.

I’m now actively seeking a software development role where I can apply my full-stack skills to build responsive, user-focused applications in a collaborative environment.

##   Project Work
The University Data with Chatbot Project  [MY project](https://university-data-with-chatbot.netlify.app/)

The University Data with Chatbot project is a user-friendly web application that provides easy access to university information through a clean interface and an interactive chatbot. It allows users—such as prospective and current students—to quickly find details about departments, courses, and campus resources without navigating complicated menus. The chatbot answers common questions naturally, improving the overall experience. The site is fully responsive, working well on phones, tablets, and desktops, and features simple navigation for ease of use. Built with React and designed with accessibility in mind, this project combines practical functionality with a modern, professional look. It is deployed online so users can access it anytime and can be expanded with additional features in the future.
