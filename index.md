# Ramya Rao Koluguri, Full Stack Developer

![My Photo](images/img_1.png)

## About Me 

I’m a detail-oriented and motivated learner with a strong foundation in front-end development, problem-solving, and collaboration—gained through real-world, team-based projects. I’m proficient in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Jest, with growing experience in Java and backend technologies.

I’ve always been curious about how applications work beneath the surface. That curiosity gradually evolved into a genuine passion for software development and ultimately led me to enroll in LaunchCode’s Software Development course.

During the program, I sharpened my skills in:

- JavaScript
- React
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL

  I’m now actively seeking a software development role where I can apply my full-stack skills to build responsive, user-focused applications in a collaborative environment.
