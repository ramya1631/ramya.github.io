I'm a detail-oriented and motivated learner with a strong foundation in front-end development, problem-solving, and collaboration—gained through real-world, team-based projects. I'm proficient in **JavaScript**, **React**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Jest**, with growing experience in **Java** and backend technologies.

I’ve always been curious about how applications work beneath the surface. That curiosity gradually evolved into a genuine passion for software development and ultimately led me to enroll in **LaunchCode’s Software Development course**.

During the program, I sharpened my skills in:

- JavaScript
- React
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL

I'm now actively seeking a software development role where I can apply my full-stack skills to build responsive, user-focused applications in a collaborative environment.
